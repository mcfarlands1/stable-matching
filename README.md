# stable-matching
Assignment from CSC 3430: Algorithm Design and Analysis, Jan. 2023. Purpose: to implement an algorithm to create a set of stable pairs using preference data read from a file.

Stable/unstable pairs definition: Given a list of preferences for each potential pair member, an unstable match is one where two pair members prefer each other to their current pair. A stable matching algorithm aims to create a set of pairs where this is not the case.
